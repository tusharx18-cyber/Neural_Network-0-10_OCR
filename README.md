# Neural_Network-0-10_OCR
this was a workshop conducted for IEEE gst ,Focuses on the understanding the core principles of  machine learning, and recogninzing 0-9 hand written notes through a datatset through a fully connected Neural Network.

## Lets start with computing output of a single neuron. the formula goes as:

$$ \text{neuron output} = \mathbf{input} \cdot \mathbf{weight} + bias $$

## Now, lets compute multiple neurons at once, also known as a layer of neurons.

$$ \text{output} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} (\text{input}_i \cdot \text{weight}_i) + \text{biases} $$

Here input and weight are arrays of float values of which dot product is calculated.
## ReLU Activation Function.
$$ \text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x) $$

ReLU is mostly used to activate hidden layers.
## SoftMax Activation

$$ \text{Softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}} $$
## Loss Calculation (Categorical Cross-Entropy)

$$ \text{Loss} = -\sum_{i} y_i \log(p_i) $$
## Adam Optimizer

### Compute the biased first moment estimate $m_t$
$$
m_t = \beta_1 \cdot m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) \cdot g_t
$$

- where $g_t$ is the gradient at time step $t$.

### Compute the biased second raw moment estimate $v_t$:

$$
v_t = \beta_2 \cdot v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) \cdot g_t^2
$$
### Compute bias-corrected first moment estimate $\hat{m}^t$:

$$\hat{m}_t = \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t}$$
